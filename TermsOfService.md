# Terms Of Service
You should know and understand your rights and our rights relating to the provision of services when installing SQLiteDevStudio. Please review them carefully. By installing the application you agree to these Terms and any supplemental terms which we make available to you on the services which shall form part of the terms.

## Registration and Accounts
The Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 years old or such higher age required in your country to use the Services. If you are under the legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.

To use the services you must create a user account on first launch. Only one account can be created per installation. All that is required is an email address and a password of your choice. The email address is used solely for password recovery. See our Privacy Policy for how personal information gathered is used. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password associated with your account and for restricting access to your password, your computer and mobile device while logged into the Services. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or from your computer and mobile devices. We endeavor to use reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to your account. We cannot, however, guarantee absolute security of your account, your content or the personal information you provide, and we cannot promise that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally accessing the Services or its contents. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, or any other breach of security, and confirm that you understand all risks of unauthorized access to data and any other information or content you provide.

You may assign your Google account to SQLiteDevStudio to retrieve your user account password. If you connect your account to your Google account the Google mail API will be used to send your SQLiteDevStudio account password via the email you provided when creating the account. By using the Google Mail API in this way you hereby agree to be bound by the Google APIs Terms of Service (including the Google privacy Policy) in connection with your use of such services. As is your right you may revoke your SQLiteDevStudio account from your Google account at any time from within the app.

## Payments
In order to access certain functionality of the Services, you will be required to pay a one-time fee. By purchasing a Premium account via In-App Google Play Billing you agree to pay the one-time fee, and other charges you incur in connection with your account. We reserve the right to increase the fee, any associated taxes, or to institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice. Changes in the Premium Services fee would not affect users who had already made a purchase.

## Cancellation
Since purchase of Premium services is a one-time fee and not a subscription there is no cancellation. We strongly recommend to trial the free version of the app (with reduced services) before purchasing the Premium version.
